## Academic Projects

This repository contains a *select* number of code samples for multiple projects I have worked on throughout my academic career. Some of these samples may intentionally be incomplete in order to avoid giving the full academic solution away to those who search for it online.

## List of Projects

1. Test Score Analyzer

   The analyzer will calculate the students score against the number of correct and incorrect questions. Pointers and arrays are used.

2. Calculate Time to Fall

   Using gravity (not precise), the program will give you an estimate for the time to fall from a chosen distance.

3. Calculate Shipping Charges

   A very basic calculator which will calculate shipping charges based on weight and distance. The cost per kilogram and max distance are hardcoded, but could easily be refactored.

4. Binary Whitelist Search

   This search was more of a for fun project for myself and you will notice the code is more advanced than my normal academic projects, but I learned quite a bit from it. Here we will have a `dataset.txt` which holds a list of whitelisted numbers. Additionally, duplicated numbers are removed after the data set is loaded into a vector array.  

   A twist is that only numbers in the data set file may be used. Binary search is used to find out if a number is inside of the data set, if not, it will return as such. You can find the binary search code in [this file](Binary%20Whitelist%20Search/WhitelistBinary/BinarySearch.h).

5. Compute Income Using Structure

   Simply uses structure objects to compute income of employees.

6. Processing Time (OOP)
   
   This project was the test our knowledge in OOP. You may see most of the code in [TimeType.h](Processing%20Time/ProcessingTime/TimeType.h) and [TimeType.cpp](Processing%20Time/ProcessingTime/TimeType.cpp). This program simply adds 30 minutes to the next object and returns the data back.
